field: a set of scalars, with two operation addition and multiplication.
closed under both operation, both operation are associative and commutative.
eg, real numbers R or complex numbers C.

group: a set G closed under a binary associative operation.
1 closure, ab in G, for all a,b in G.
2 associative, (ab)c = a(bc) for all a,b,c in G.
3 identity, exist 1, such that 1a = a for all a in G.
4 inverse, exist b such that ab = 1, for each a.
semi-group, Let (G,*) be a semi-group. require closure & associative, but not
identity & inverse.

abelian group, commutative group, a group whose binary operation is commutative.


space, vector space: a set with two binary operations. first operation turn the
set into an abelian group. second operation is scalar multiplication.
A vector space is an abelian group with an action by a field.
