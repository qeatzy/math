proving a group has exactly one idempotent element - Fraleigh p. 48 4.31
If * is a binary operation on a set S, an element x of S is idempotent for * if
x*x = x. prove that a group has exactly one idempotent element.
 x*x = x
 x*x* x^-1 = x* x^-1
 x*e = e
 x = e
since identity of group is unique, there is only on such element.

prove left inverse and right inverse are the same. or put it another way,
a left inverse is also a right inverse, and vice versa.
 yx = xz = e     -- y is left inverse, z is right inverse
 (yx)z = y(xz)
 z = y
also it proves inverse is unique. suppose y,z different then contradict.
suppose e1,e2 are two identity,
e1 = e1 e2 = e2
this prove identity is unique.

Show identity of subgroup is same as identity of group
suppose H is subgroup of G.
 1H * 1H = 1H = 1H * 1G
 left multiply by inverse of 1H.
 1H = 1G
